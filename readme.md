# CS 577: Deep Learning  

## Course Overview  
Taught by **Yutong Wang**, this course focuses on understanding the internals of **deep learning frameworks** such as **PyTorch**. It helped me grasp concepts like **backpropagation, loss functions, optimizers**, and their applications. The course includes **six assignments, one project, and two exams**.  

## Main Topics  
- **Regression**: From linear regression to kernel methods to neural networks  
- **Classification**: Loss functions, cross entropy, numerical stability  
- **Optimizers**: Momentum, adaptive methods  
- **Backpropagation**  
- **Computer Vision**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- **Hardware**

## **Directory Structure**  

### **Assignments/**  
Contains my solutions for each assignment:  

- **First Assignment**: Introduction to **LaTeX** and implementation of the **Perceptron Algorithm**.  
- **Second Assignment**: Implementation of **gradient descent** and solving **probability and regression problems**.  
- **Third Assignment**: Worked with **tensors (3D data structures)**, implementing **forward and loss functions**, and computing **derivatives** of given functions.  
- **Fourth Assignment**: Implemented **backpropagation** using the **Autograd library** for automatic differentiation. Applied **gradient descent** with tensors.  
- **Fifth Assignment**: Implemented and analyzed a **simplified TransformerBlock**, focusing on:
  - **SingleHeadAttention Layer**: Performs **sequence-to-sequence mapping** using **self-attention**.  
  - **MLP Layer**: Applies a **single hidden layer** with **ReLU activation** to the attention output.  

### **Exams/**  
Contains **problems and solutions** used to prepare for both exams.  

### **Lectures/**  
Contains **slides and notebooks** used in the course.  

### **Project/**  
Our project focused on **developing and testing a simplified version of BERT**. We **pretrained the model** using:  
- **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**  
- **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**  

Finally, we **fine-tuned** the model for **sentiment classification** on the **IMDB dataset** of movie reviews, achieving **81.91% accuracy**.
